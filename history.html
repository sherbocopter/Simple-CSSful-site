			<h1 class="myTitle">Leo Fender</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				Clarence Leonidas "Leo" Fender (August 10, 1909 â€“ March 21, 1991) was 
				an American inventor who founded Fender Electric Instrument 
				Manufacturing Company, or "Fender" for short. In January 1965, he 
				sold the company to CBS and later founded two other musical 
				instrument companies, Music Man and G&L Musical Instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The guitars, bass guitars, and amplifiers he designed from the 1940s 
				on are still relevant: the Fender Telecaster (1950) was the first 
				mass-produced solid-body electric guitar; the Fender Stratocaster 
				(1954) is among the world's most iconic electric guitars; the Fender 
				Precision Bass (1951) set the standard for electric bass guitars, 
				and the Fender Bassman amplifier, popular enough in its own right, 
				became the basis for later amplifiers (notably by Marshall and Mesa 
				Boogie) that dominated rock and roll music. Leo Fender was inducted 
				into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 - a unique achievement 
				given that he never learned to play the instruments that he made a 
				career of building.

			<h1 class="myTitle">Origins</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				The company began as Fender's Radio Service in late 1938 in 
				Fullerton, California. It got its name from the surname of its 
				founder Leo Fender. As a qualified electronics technician, Leo 
				Fender had been asked to repair not only radios, but phonograph 
				players, home audio amplifiers, public address systems and musical 
				instrument amplifiers. (At the time, most of these were just 
				variations on a few simple vacuum-tube circuits.) All designs were 
				based on research developed and released to the public domain by 
				Western Electric in the 1930s and used vacuum tubes for 
				amplification. The business also sidelined in carrying records for 
				sale and the rental of self-designed PA systems. Leo became intrigued 
				by design flaws in contemporary musical instrument amplifiers and 
				began building amplifiers based on his own designs or modifications 
				to designs.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the early 1940s he had partnered with local electronics enthusiast 
				Clayton Orr "Doc" Kauffman and together they formed the company K & F 
				Manufacturing Corp to design, manufacture, and market electric 
				instruments and amplifiers. Production began in 1945 with Hawaiian 
				lap steel guitars (incorporating a patented pickup) and amplifiers 
				sold as sets. By the end of the year Fender became convinced that 
				manufacturing was more profitable than repair and he decided to 
				concentrate on that business instead. Kauffman however remained 
				unconvinced and he and Fender amicably parted ways by early 1946. At 
				that point Leo renamed the company the Fender Electric Instrument 
				Company. The service shop remained open until 1951, although Leo 
				Fender did not personally supervise it after 1947.

			<h1 class="myTitle">Sale to CBS</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				In early 1965, Leo Fender sold his companies to the Columbia 
				Broadcasting System (CBS) for $13 million. This was almost two 
				million more than they had paid for The New York Yankees a year 
				before. CBS entered the musical instruments field by acquiring the 
				Fender companies (Fender Sales, Inc., Fender Electric Instrument 
				Company, Inc., Fender Acoustic Instrument Company, Inc., 
				Fender-Rhodes, Inc., Terrafen, Inc., Clef-Tronix, Inc., Randall 
				Publishing Co., Inc., and V.C. Squier Company), as well as 
				Electro-Music Inc. (Leslie speakers), Rogers drums, Steinway pianos, 
				Gemeinhardt flutes, Lyon & Healy harps, Rodgers (institutional) 
				organs, and Gulbransen home organs.
			</p>
			<p>
				This had far-reaching implications. The sale was taken as a positive 
				development, considering CBS's ability to bring in money and 
				personnel who acquired a large inventory of Fender parts and u
				nassembled guitars that were assembled and put to market. However, 
				the sale also led to a reduction of the quality of Fender's guitars 
				while under the management of "cost-cutting" CBS. Several cosmetic 
				changes occurred after 1965/1966, such as a larger headstock shape on 
				certain guitars. Bound necks with block shaped position markers were 
				introduced in 1966. A bolder black headstock logo, as well as a 
				brushed aluminum face plate with blue or red labels (depending the 
				model) for the guitar and bass amplifiers became standard features, 
				starting in 1968.
