			<p>
				The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele, is the world's 
				first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple 
				yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set 
				trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced 
				for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it 
				was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale 
				and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its 
				first incarnation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Fender Telecaster was developed by Leo Fender in Fullerton, 
				California in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949, 
				several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric 
				guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market. Leo 
				Fender's Telecaster was the design that finally put the solid-body 
				guitar on the map.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Telecaster is known for its ability to produce both bright, rich, 
				cutting tone (the typical telecaster country twang) or mellow, warm, 
				bluesy jazz tone depending on the selected pickup, respectively 
				"bridge" pickup or "neck" pickup, and by adjusting the tone control. 
				The bridge pickup has more windings than the neck pickup, hence 
				producing higher output, which compensates for a lower amplitude of 
				vibration of the strings at bridge position. At the same time, a 
				capacitor between the slider of the volume control and the output 
				allows treble sounds to bleed through while damping mid and lower 
				ranges. Slanting the bridge pickup also increased the guitar's treble 
				response. The solid body allows the guitar to deliver a clear and 
				sustaining amplified version of the strings' sound; this was an 
				improvement over previous electric guitar designs, whose resonant 
				hollow bodies made them prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. These 
				design elements intentionally allowed guitarists to emulate steel 
				guitar sounds, as well as "cut-through" and be heard in roadhouse 
				Honky-Tonk and big Western Swing bands, initially making this guitar 
				particularly useful in country music. Its wide range of tonalities 
				allows the Telecaster to be used successfully for many styles of music 
				including country, pop, rock, blues and jazz.

			<hr/>
			<p>
				The Fender Stratocaster was the first guitar to feature three pickups 
				and a spring tension tremolo system, as well as being the first Fender 
				with a contoured body. The Stratocaster's sleek, contoured body shape 
				(officially referred to by Fender as the "Comfort Contour Body") 
				differed from the flat, slab-like design of the Telecaster. The 
				Stratocaster's double cutaways allowed players easier access to higher 
				positions on the neck.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starting in 1954, the Stratocaster was offered with a solid, deeply 
				contoured ash body, a 21-fret one-piece maple neck with black dot 
				inlays, and Kluson tuning heads. The color was originally a two color 
				sunburst pattern, although custom color guitars were produced (most 
				famously Eldon Shamblin's gold Stratocaster, dated 6/1954). In 1956,
				Fender began using alder for sunburst and most custom color 
				Stratocaster bodies; ash was still used on translucent blonde 
				instruments. In 1960, the available custom colors were standardized, 
				many of which were automobile lacquer colors from DuPont available at 
				an additional 5% cost. A unique single-ply, 8-screw hole white 
				pickguard held all electronic components except the recessed jack 
				plate-facilitating easy assembly.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Stratocaster features three single coil pickups, with the output 
				originally selected by a 3-way switch. Guitarists soon discovered that 
				by jamming the switch in between the 1st and 2nd position, both the 
				bridge and middle pickups could be selected, and similarly, the middle 
				and neck pickups could be selected between the 2nd and 3rd position. 
				In 1977 Fender introduced a 5-way selector making such pickup 
				combinations more stable.
			</p>
			<p>
				The "quacky" tone of the middle and bridge pickups, popularized by 
				players such as David Gilmour, Rory Gallagher, Mark Knopfler, Bob 
				Dylan, Scott Thurston, Ronnie Wood, Ed King, Eric Clapton and Robert 
				Cray, can be obtained by using the pickup selector in positions 2 and 
				4. The neck and middle pickups are each wired to a tone control that 
				incorporates a single, shared tone capacitor, whereas the bridge 
				pickup, which is slanted towards the high strings for a more trebly 
				sound, has no tone control for maximum brightness. On many modern 
				Stratocasters, the first tone affects the neck pickup; the second tone 
				affects the middle and bridge pickups; on some Artist Series models 
				(Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy signature guitars), the first tone is a 
				presence circuit that cuts or boosts treble and bass frequencies, 
				affecting all the pickups; the second tone is an active midrange 
				booster that boosts the midrange frequencies up to 25 dB (12 dB on 
				certain models) to produce a fatter humbucker-like sound.
