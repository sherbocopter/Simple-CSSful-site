			<hr/>
			<p>
				The original Precision Bass of 1951 shared several of its design 
				features with the six-string Telecaster guitar, the main difference 
				being its double cutaway body. In 1953 the Precision Bass received 
				contoured edges for comfort while otherwise retaining the existing 
				Telecaster-like styling.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1957 the headstock and pickguard were redesigned to resemble 
				Fender's recently introduced Stratocaster guitar, a rounder neck heel 
				replacing the original square shape. A redesigned pick-guard was made 
				of a single layer of gold-anodized aluminum with 10 screwholes. At the 
				same time the original single-coil pickup was replaced by the Precision 
				split-coil design with staggered polepieces, connected in a humbucking 
				mode; however, Fender never emphasized this, as the Seth Lover patent 
				on the humbucking pickup had not yet expired.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1959 a glued-on rosewood fingerboard featuring "clay"-style dot 
				position markers replaced the 1-piece maple neck and remained standard 
				until 1966/67, when the CBS-owned Fender companies began to offer a 
				separate, laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood 
				fingerboards were then made of a veneered, round-laminated piece of 
				wood and pearloid dot markers replaced the "clay"-style inlays 
				introduced in 1959.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1960 the aluminum pick-guard was replaced with a 13-screw celluloid 
				design having 3 or 4 layers of black, white, mint green, aged white 
				pearloid or brown "tortoise-shell"). In that same year the 
				newly-designed Fender Jazz Bass was released.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus 
				basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner 
				bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain 
				models. The Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was a luxurious 
				version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted 
				maple top and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The American Series Precision Bass was introduced in 2000 and 
				discontinued in 2008. From 2003 the S-1 switching system allowed the 
				pickup coils to be switched from series to parallel,offering a wider 
				tonal range, but this was discontinued in 2008 with the second 
				generation of American Standard Series instruments.

			<hr/>
			<p>
				First introduced in 1960 as the Deluxe Model, it was marketed as 
				a stablemate to the Jazzmaster guitar which was also marketed as 
				a Deluxe Model in its own right. It was renamed the Jazz Bass as 
				Fender felt that its redesigned neck—narrower and more rounded 
				than that of the Precision Bass—would appeal more to jazz musicians.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jazz Bass has two single coil pickups with two pole pieces per 
				string. This gave the bass a stronger treble sound to compete with 
				the Rickenbacker bass, which had been introduced in 1957 and was 
				famously "bright". As well as having a slightly different, less 
				symmetrical and more contoured body shape (known in Fender 
				advertising as the "Offset Waist Contour" body), the Jazz Bass neck 
				is noticeably narrower at the nut than that of the Fender Precision 
				Bass. While the Precision Bass was originally styled similarly to 
				the Telecaster guitar, the Jazz Bass' styling was inspired by the 
				Jazzmaster guitar, with which the Jazz shared its offset body and 
				sculpted edges that differentiate it from other slab-style bass 
				bodies.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jazz Bass has a bright sound, with more high end than the Precision 
				Bass. This makes it ideal for slap playing as well as finger-style 
				players. This bright sound is due to the fact that there are two pickups 
				at different points in the string's length. The bridge pickup gives a 
				tone with more treble, while the neck pickup will yield a rounder sound. 
				The ability to blend the volume of both pickups allows for a wider 
				variety of tones than the Precision Bass can produce. Pickups are RWRP 
				(reverse wound, reverse polarity) from one another, so all hum will be 
				canceled when both pickups are at full volume.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having both pickups cranked up at full volume produces the classic 
				scooped, "growling" sound which many players—such as Marcus Miller 
				and Will Lee—use for slap bass playing. This sound is the product of 
				certain frequencies from both pickups being out of phase and cancelling 
				each other, leaving a "scoop" on the midrange. This is similar to what 
				happens on some guitars when you blend the sounds from two different 
				pickups, such as the Fender Stratocaster.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some "Deluxe" Jazz Bass models feature an active pre-amp (usually with 
				three bands of equalization) in place of a single passive tone control, 
				these basses have three separate equalizer controls: bass and treble 
				responses are controlled by the base and top of a stacked double pot, 
				while midrange is controlled by a second knob. They came with 22 frets, 
				abalone dot position inlays and an 18-volt power supply on some models. 
				Known as Jazz Bass Deluxe since introduced as part of a major reworking 
				of Fender's Electric Bass lineup in 1995, they have been renamed the 
				American Deluxe Jazz Bass to the public as of August 2000 in a Bass 
				Player magazine review of the new "Fender American Deluxe Precision V" 
				five-string counterpart model to the American Deluxe Jazz Bass.
